# S5-Step-2
Step-2
Target:
Adding batch norm and drop out to reduce over fitting and improve the model efficiency.
Iterated dropout value from 0.05 to 0.2 
Results 
Parameters: 13,584
Making 0.05 as Dropout value as the results were best, difference b/w test and train accuracy were low
Best Train Accuracy   99.12
Best Test Accuracy 99.45%
Analysis 
Model is under fitting and total parameters also > 10k
